The lab for CL course will be based on the use of `ANTLR4 <http://www.antlr.org/>`_, a powerful parser generator.

The first two lab sessions will be devoted to getting acquainted with ANTLR4, and with the different possibilities it offers. We will do this following a simple example such as building a basic calculator.

The rest of the sessions will be used to work on the project (building a compiler for a simple imperative language) in teams of two people.

One of the lab sessions (towards half of the course) will be a practical exam on ANTLR4.
The last lab session will be a final exam on the developed project.
