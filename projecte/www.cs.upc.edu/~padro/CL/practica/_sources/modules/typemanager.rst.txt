  
Type Manager
------------

This class stores information about all types existing in a program. A *type* stores
information required to perform type checking.

Note that this includes not only primitive types, but programmer-defined types such as *array of 10 integers*
or *function that receives a boolean and an array of 5 char and returns an integer*.

Thus, class ``TypesMgr`` class stores all seen types, and offers methods to find out information about them
when we are type checking or generating code. For instance:

 - *is type X an array?*
 - *is type X the same than type Y?*
 - *is type X compatible with type Y?*
 - *which type have the elements of type X?* (when *X* is an array type, obviously)
 - *which type returns type X?* (when *X* is a function type, obviously)

Here is the whole definition of ``TypesMgr``. Check the comments to find out what each method does.
